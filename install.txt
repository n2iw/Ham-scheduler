1) Create a new database in MySQL
2) Create a new user in MySQL (or you can use an existed user), make sure
    this user has all privilege for the database created in step 1
3) Use phpMyAdmin to load initial.sql into database created in step 1
4) Make a copy of includes/constants-init.php rename it includes/constants.php,
    Edit includes/constants.php, fill in information that fits your club
    A line like: define("DATABASE", "W1AW_2_2014_test"); you will want to
    change the second string, leave the first string untouched. 
    lines with ***** above it are most important ones     
    Use UTC dates only!!!
    Remember to change the time zone to: “America/New_York”, “America/Chicago”, 
    “America/Denver” or “America/Los_Angeles”, if you have a different time
    zone, there is a link in constants.php, you can find a suitable one there.
5) Upload files to server, and change their permissions, make sure all .php
    files are 600, all folders are 711 and all other files are 644
6) In your browser, goto your schedule application's login page 
    for example: the test site is in a folder called "w1aw-test", this folder
    is in the root directory of n2iw.com, so we enter url 
    "n2iw.com/w1aw-test/login.php" in our browser
    login with user: N2IW password: MingJamesYing
7) In your browser, goto your schedule application's  install.php 
    such as "n2iw.com/w1aw-test/install.php", you should see a success message
    you may have to wait a couple of minutes before you will see the message!
8) Delete install.php install.txt and initial.sql from server
9) Add users  in Management/Add user page
10) Give at least one user Administrator privilege by Edit user in Management/Edit user page, 
11) Change the password of user N2IW
12)Login with other Administrator user
13)Edit user N2IW, make it read only user (optional)

Note: if you manage your own server, please make sure that "short_open_tag"
needs to be set "On" in php.ini. On Centos 6.5 it is Off by default. 
Also httpd needs to be restarted after changing the php.ini for the value to
be re-read. (Thanks Steve W1SRD)
